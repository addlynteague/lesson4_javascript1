### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (In JavaScript, you only need to type 'var' when creating a variable. You don't need to use a particular data type, since JavaScript is a loosely typed language.)
2. (Local variables are within a function and can not be activated or used outside of that function.)
3. (Static typing is strong and requires you to declare your data types while dynamic typing is loose and does not require you to declare data types.)
